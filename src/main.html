        <svg id="chart3"></svg>
        <p><strong>Team Total Points vs Average Age:</strong> All 31 teams find their average age between 26 and 30.
          Most teams will find themselves
          below an average age of 29. Playoff teams found themselves typically within ages 27 or 28, although some
          outliers exist at 26 and 29.
        </p>

        <svg id="chart4"></svg>
        <p><strong>Individual: Total Points</strong> The top 20 players in the NHL 2018-2019 regular season were within

        <svg id="chart5"></svg>
        <p><strong>Individual: Goals vs Assists</strong> Analyzing the top 100 players by points, the largest cluster of
          players
          lie below 35 goals and 50 assists. Generally, more players maintain more assists than goals. Some outliers
          exist such as Alexander Ovechkin or John Tavares.
        </p>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p><strong>Overall Story</strong> The overall story of the dataset is primarily connected to high performances
          and team/player total points.
          Generally speaking, no immediately strong correlations are present in the data, something that was ultimately
          figured out as it was completed.
          That said, some loose connections can be made, such as the higher performing teams naturally having a higher
          goal differential and with an average age of 27.</p>
